#CourseAnalyzer
CourseAnalyzer takes the list of courses from courses.txt and downloads the raw course information from the Louisiana State University course catalog into the folder `course_cache`. 
It then proceeds to parse all of the courses and sections into objects. 
Finally, statistics (or reports) are generated into a static html website, and are merged into the gh-pages branch, available at [https://blaketillman.github.io/CourseAnalyzer](https://blaketillman.github.io/CourseAnalyzer).
